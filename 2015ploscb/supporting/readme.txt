This package contains supporting data and MATLAB code for:

     Murray, R. F., Patel, K., & Yee, A. (2015).  Posterior probability matching and human perceptual decision making.  PLOS Computational Biology, 11(6): e1004342.

The package can be downloaded from http://purl.org/NET/rfm/ploscb2015.


The files figure3a.m and figure3b.m are top-level scripts that generate data in figures 3a and 3b in Murray, Patel, and Yee (2015).

pcpa2ie.m is a function that is called by the top-level scripts to calculate the internal-to-external noise ratio from proportion correct and proportion of consistent responses.

The directory 'data' contains trial-by-trial data from experiments 1 and 2.


This code was developed in MATLAB 8.3 (R2014a).  It requires the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox.
