This package contains supporting data and MATLAB code for:

     Pritchett, L. M., & Murray, R. F. (2015).  Classification images reveal decision variables and strategies in forced choice tasks.  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A., 112(23), 7321-7326.

The package can be downloaded from http://purl.org/NET/rfm/pnas2015.


The files figure2a.m, figure2b.m, figure2c.m, figure3.m, and figure4.m are top-level scripts that generate figures from Pritchett and Murray (2015).

The file figureS3.m is a top-level script that runs a Monte Carlo simulation discussed in connection with Supporting Figure S3 in Pritchett and Murray (2015).

The directory 'data' contains trial-by-trial data from experiments 1 and 2.

The directory 'tools' contains routines that are used by the top-level scripts.


This code was developed in MATLAB 8.3 (R2014a).  It requires the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox.
